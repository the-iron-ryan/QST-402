    "Lets attempt to improve our eavesdropping. This can simply be done by having Eve measure in Alice's basis instead of in Bob's basis. If she sucessfully measures in the parallel basis to the incoming state, she's gaurunteed to get a click and knows the state. If she gets a 0, then she just simply sends a random state. This will significantly decrease our error rate down to roughly 25%."
